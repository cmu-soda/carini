Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-01-05 17:19:49.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.9E-9
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.3E-9
833674 states generated, 98645 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 20.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 12 and the 95th percentile is 3).

Round 1
-------
TLC neg trace generation time: 0.73 seconds
# neg traces: 1
# min neg traces: 1
partial neg trace generation time: 0.258 seconds
attempting to eliminate the following neg trace this round:
NT1 (NegTrace): (T0->ServerProcessDbResponsen1id1resp1 + T1->ReceiveResponsen1resp1)

Init pos trace:
PT1 (PosTrace): (T0->ServerProcessRequestn2req3id2)
Using the following partial neg trace for formula synth:
NT1 (NegTrace): (T0->ServerProcessDbResponsen1id1resp1)
Formula synth batch: 1
Total # workers: 64
# workers using: 10
First worker finished, shutdown count is 30.0s
Formula synthesis complete in 5.836 seconds
\A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_58[var0]) => (Fluent1_58[var0])
  Fluent2_58[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      ServerProcessDbResponse[0] = TRUE (0)
  Fluent1_58[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      ServerProcessRequest[0] = TRUE (0)

Found the following new invariant this round:
\A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_58[var0]) => (Fluent1_58[var0])
  Fluent2_58[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      ServerProcessDbResponse[0] = TRUE (0)
  Fluent1_58[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      ServerProcessRequest[0] = TRUE (0)

Minimizing the invariants found thus far.
Minimization finished in 0.001 seconds
Current partial assumption:
/\ \A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_58[var0]) => (Fluent1_58[var0])
Round 1 took 8.018 seconds

Init pos trace:
PT1 (PosTrace): (T0->NewRequestn1req1 + T1->ServerProcessRequestn1req1id1 + T2->ServerProcessRequestn2req3id2)
Using the following partial neg trace for formula synth:

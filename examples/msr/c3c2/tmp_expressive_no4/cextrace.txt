Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-03-01 11:47:45.
Progress(13) at 2025-03-01 11:47:48: 196,157 states generated (196,157 s/min), 51,790 distinct states found (51,790 ds/min), 22,196 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.2E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 9.3E-9
2093062 states generated, 337876 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 32.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 10 and the 95th percentile is 3).

Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-07-30 08:56:33.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.5E-15
712 states generated, 108 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 11.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 5 and the 95th percentile is 4).

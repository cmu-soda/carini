Computed 2 initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 4 states generated, with 3 of them distinct at 2024-12-25 13:07:21.
Progress(7) at 2024-12-25 13:07:24: 2,326 states generated (2,326 s/min), 287 distinct states found (287 ds/min), 56 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.0E-13
10120 states generated, 789 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 14.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 17 and the 95th percentile is 4).

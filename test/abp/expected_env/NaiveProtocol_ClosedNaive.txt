TLA+ Module: NaiveProtocol
Diff rep grouped by action:

Receive1:
Safety boundary representation: out/NaiveProtocol_Receive1_diff_rep.txt
Safety boundary rep formula (with sort definitions):
/\ receiverState = "waitRec"
/\ senderState # "waitInput"

GetAck0:
Safety boundary representation: out/NaiveProtocol_GetAck0_diff_rep.txt
Safety boundary rep formula (with sort definitions):
Sort1 == {"Kevin","David","Ian"}
/\ senderState = "waitAck"
/\ senderBit = 0
/\ \A S \in Sort1 : ((output = S \/ input # S \/ receiverState = "waitRec") /\ (receiverState = "waitRec" => receiverBit = 1) /\ (output # S \/ input # S \/ receiverState # "waitRec"))

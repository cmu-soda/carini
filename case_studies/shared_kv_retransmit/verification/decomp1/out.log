Round 1
-------
TLC neg trace generation time: 0.841 seconds
# neg traces: 1
# min neg traces: 1
partial neg trace generation time: 0.267 seconds
attempting to eliminate the following neg trace this round:
NT1 (NegTrace): (T0->retransmitn1n1k1v1NUM1 + T1->recv_transfer_msgn1n1k1v1NUM1 + T2->putn2k1v1)

Init pos trace:
PT1 (PosTrace): (T0->reshardn1n2k1v1NUM2)
Using the following partial neg trace for formula synth:
NT1 (NegTrace): (T0->retransmitn1n1k1v1NUM1)
Formula synth batch: 1

\A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_59[var0]) => (Fluent1_59[var0])
  Fluent1_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      reshard[0] = TRUE
  Fluent2_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      retransmit[0] = TRUE

Found the following new invariant this round:
\A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_59[var0]) => (Fluent1_59[var0])
  Fluent1_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      reshard[0] = TRUE
  Fluent2_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      retransmit[0] = TRUE

Minimizing the invariants found thus far.
Minimization finished in 0.001 seconds
Current partial assumption:
/\ \A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_59[var0]) => (Fluent1_59[var0])
Round 1 took 306.333 seconds

Round 2
-------
TLC neg trace generation time: 0.147 seconds
Round 2 took 0.154 seconds

The following formula is a separating assumption:
/\ \A var0 \in Node : (Fluent2_59[var0]) => (Fluent1_59[var0])
  Fluent1_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      reshard[0] = TRUE
  Fluent2_59[Node]
    initially: FALSE
    flActions:
      retransmit[0] = TRUE
